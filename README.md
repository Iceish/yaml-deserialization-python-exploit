# Exploit YAML Python Deserialization

This is a Python script designed to exploit a vulnerability in applications that deserialize YAML data without proper security measures. The script generates a malicious YAML payload containing a base64-encoded command, which, when deserialized, executes the command on the target system.

## Usage
The script currently uses a hardcoded GET request to send the payload. You may need to modify the script to suit the specifics of your target application. The section to modify is clearly marked with `# EDIT ENDPOINT HERE`.

`python3 exploit.py <url> <cmd>`
Set `url` with the URL of the vulnerable endpoint and `cmd` with the command you want to execute.

For example: `python3 exploit.py http://example.com/vulnerable_endpoint ls`
